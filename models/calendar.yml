        title: How a Statute Helped Shape the Internet, for Both Good and Bad
        description: |
          Section 230 was a part of a the Communications Decency Act of 1996. While the act
          itself was meant to restrict free speech, Section 230 has allowed internet companies to
          operate as distributers of information, like bookstores, instead of traditional publishers,
          such as newspapers. The consequences of this freedom has been both
          good and bad. I'm going to talk about the challenges of keeping people safe while
          companies have started to moderate abuse, hate speech, and disinformation.

        description: | 
          “Stack overflow”! “Maximum call stack size exceeded”!! “Too much recursion”!!!<br><br>
          You may have seen errors like these when you attempt to run a deeply recursive function. Computers can be so dramatic! But what’s the conflict, exactly, between recursion and call stacks? And is there any hope for resolving it into a happy ending? In this musical talk we'll see why recursion poses a problem for our finite-memory call stack, and learn how "Tail Call Optimization" (TCO) lets us get around that problem.<br><br>
          We’ll sing our way through the meaning of these terms to explore how TCO messes with the call stack (in a useful way!), as we mess with the lyrics to some of our favorite animated musical songs (in a nerdy way!).

          Pink Trombone (https://dood.al/pinktrombone/) is a web tool that lets

          cavity, tongue, and throat. Are those building blocks actually enough
          for speech, and can we teach Pink Trombone to speak English words?
          What sounds are especially difficult to produce - for humans, and in
          the app - and why? Join me in digging into the technology behind this
          app and learning more about how our voices really work.

        description: |
          For witches, werewolves, and wizards, the phases of the moon can be a problem because
          certain kinds of magic only work on certain phases of the moon. For programmers, the
          phases of the moon is a problem that can be solved by an algorithm. In this talk, the
          magical meets the mathematical as we take a look at how to calculate the phases of the
          moon.<br /><br />
          We'll write code that calculates the percent illumination of the moon based on the
          current position of the moon and sun, and step by step, go over the trigonometry proofs
          that show how it works.

          the "internet programming" environment that Apple built for kids in the late 90s. I'll
          fire up a Mac OS 7 emulator and show what made Cocoa so groundbreaking. I'll explain
          how "programming by demonstration" and "actor-based" educational environments lower the
          barrier to entry in computer science and establish mental models that make it easier for
          kids to write great JavaScript later. tldr: Don't teach kids to write for loops, teach
          them to think about state machines and scopes!

                     my first maker project called "Sharknicorn" -- a 3D printed unicorn horn on a shark hat
                     that has light animations depending on the realtime state of your Uber ride! We'll be going over

          Regular expressions are one of the most mind-boggling programming techniques, but much of their mystery can be elucidated by tracking down how they made it into JavaScript in the first place.
          In this talk, I’ll tell the story of the regular expression, from its humble linguistic origins to its awe-inspiring power in modern programming languages like JavaScript.
          Once I reveal to the audience the linguistic theory behind regular expressions, they’ll feel empowered to start writing some of their own.

          How to Estimate Like a Pro
        description: |
          Fundamentally, every engineer hates/cringes when they need to give an
          estimate. We beat ourselves up over it when we get them wrong. In
          my past I've been an engineer, a lead, a product manager and
          engineering manager. This is my perspective on when/why they matter
          and when they don't. I also have a few tips for delivering estimates,
          when you actually need to give them. Hopefully, I'll deliver this
          presentation in the alotted timeframe 😎.

          Practical Things You Can Do to Protect the Privacy of Your Users
        description: |
          Protecting privacy is the right thing to do. Consider especially that
          a few of your users may be people such as political dissidents or
          victims of domestic abuse that are especially vulnerable to privacy
          violation. Protecting privacy also makes business sense. You want to
          protect against a big data breach that could destroy your company's
          reputation, or to comply with upcoming European privacy regulations
          that apply to all apps worldwide. However privacy can be hard to get a
          handle on, because it is often explained using legal jargon. In this
          talk I speak as a fellow developer and outline the practical
          engineering things you can do, concentrating on protecting data you
          store in your backends.

          you’ve probably had to fix bugs with other people—and
          sometimes that’s the hardest part. When your logs have expired,
          you can’t reproduce the issue, and you’ve tested five different
          hypotheses, maybe it’s time to give someone else a shot. But
          what's the best way to do that? I’ll talk about the workflow I
          use to collaboratively debug issues without repeating work or
          losing progress and why it makes sense.

          The Magic of Erasure Codes
        description: |
          Imagine you had a set of 100 files, and you could
          generate 4 extra files that could later recover up to 4 missing
          files from the set. Sound like magic? Fortunately, it’s real,
          and by the end of this talk, you’ll know how it works!

          "Works for Me": Understanding Privilege in Tech
        description: |
          "Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed. "Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't inaccurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others. This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.

          256, 128, and of course, all of those 0's and 1's that make up binary.
          But there's one number that's super magical, and almost all of us have
          interacted with it as JavaScript developers. The number 16! This talk
          will look at the awesomeness of hexadeimcal numbers. We'll explore the
          logic behind color hex codes, and the math that's behind converting
          between rgb and hex codes. Behind the hex codes that we are all
          familiar with is a powerful hexadecimal number systems. We'll explore
          why the base 16 number system is so common in computer science, and
          look at hexadecimals in the wild (for example, in hex speak and even
          in IP addresses!). Let's fall under the spell of hexadecimal numbers
          and learn why exactly they are so powerful and popular.

          performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I
          will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near
          native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance
          applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.

        description:
          I'm a huge fan of mood lighting and app reliability. Related? Of
          course!  I heard about Progressive Web Apps and thought it was a
          great way to make web applications more accessible, so I wanted to
          give it a try. (Disclaimer🤓  I don't think PWAs are going to replace
          mobile apps just yet, but I do think they're a great way to make our
          web apps even more awesome) At the same time I had been wanting to
          create an application that let me control Philips Hue lights. That
          way I could go anywhere and set the mood with my handy-dandy portable
          lights. So, if I went outside to enjoy my yard, on the roof to hang
          out with friends, or WaffleJS to chill with amazing people, I could
          easily set the appropriate mood lighting with my app.  I would like
          to share my experience with all of you and show off my new toys 😊

        title: Why React is so Fast
        emoji: 🤔
        description:
          React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library
          designed to manage the view layer of complex UIs. In recent
          years, it has established itself as the dominant library for
          building responsive and highly-performant interfaces. But all
          of what React does feels like it's happening in a black box!
          So, I hope to explain why React is so efficient by
          highlighting 2 key features -- React's virtual DOM and diff
          algorithm. Don't worry if you're not a React pro, this talk
          is intended to be accessible to all audiences!

            GraphQL is a powerful technology providing client an efficient and elegant way to fetch data,
            getting exactly the data and avoid multiple round-trips. I'm a co-author of library called Allograph.
            Allograph aims to integrate the various tools around GraphQL to provide a rapid development framework
            to enhance developer experience. After the talk, you'll gain deeper understanding on GraphQL itself,
            with perspectives on how to build a GraphQL backend either alongside an existing app or from scratch.

          not a matter swapping out one service for another, it requires that we
          rethink many of our assumptions about trust and infrastructure. It requires
          that we build a lot more open source software infrastructure to make the
          basic tools like signing and encryption as usable as we've made the rest
          of our software infrastructure.

          transitioned from waterfall to XP, scaled our team to be globally distributed,
          and replaced core architectural components with zero downtime. While the
          tech industry routinely encounters these challenges, doing so as an OS
          product and maintaining shared vision throughout presents unique challenges.

          their results were all immediately available. This feature
          is implemented in the latest beta versions of Chrome and Firefox
          and you can get them anywhere by means of closure-compiler.

          You’re so pumped. You found an API that will bring

          nobody knows how to use this API. Stack Overflow
          has failed you. Documentation is clearly a novella
          rather than being straightforward. What do you do?
          Do you just give up and build from scratch? No!
          In this talk, you will learn not to give up in these
          situations. Like Nancy Drew, you can hunt down the

        title: Fold, Paper, Scissors
        description: |
          This talk looks beyond origami as a childhood
          pastime and an art form and explores origami
          as a source of many interesting mathematical
          problems, including one called the
          fold-and-cut problem. The fold and cut theorem
          states that it is possible, given a piece of
          paper and any polygonal shape, to find a
          series of folds of that paper such that the
          given shape can be generated with a single cut.
          This talk explores a proof of the theorem and
          an implementation of a solver that determines
          the correct series of folds given any input
          polygon. There will be a live demo of the
          program and paper cutting!

          overview of the 4 waves of Feminism, talk about ways to spot
          toxic patriarchy, and give some suggestions on how to be your
