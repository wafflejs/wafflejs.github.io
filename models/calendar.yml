        description: 'Have you heard about "A/B testing"? Have you not heard
        about "A/B testing"? If you answered "yes" to either of these questions,
        this talk is for you! At Khan Academy we use A/B testing to help
        millions of learners remember things better, pick them up faster,
        and learn more often. In this talk we’ll cover the basics of learning
        science and show how you can use the power of numbers to make better
        (or at least better informed) decisions!'
