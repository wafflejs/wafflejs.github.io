          coming to a JS meetup in San Francisco, chances are that you are an
          engineer working for a startup. This talk will cover, with math, the
          absolute bare minimum that you ought to know about how startup equity
          works. You won't walk out a finance guru, but at least you'll know
          what the words mean, and have a much better idea of what VCs and
          founders are talking about (what happens next will shock you!)
