        description:
          Jest snapshots are great for testing React components, but they can be used for a whole lot more.
          Let's take a deep dive into some uncommon use cases for snapshot testing.
          For example, we can use them for you Webpack config, or to keep track of the number of ESLint warnings.
          This exploration aims to grow the snapshot ecosystem and figure out what new opportunities exist for the testing community.

        title: Hexes and the Magic of Base 16
        description:
          Some numbers seem to be extra cool in the world of computer science -
          256, 128, and of course, all of those 0's and 1's that make up binary.
          But there's one number that's super magical, and almost all of us have
          interacted with it as JavaScript developers. The number 16! This talk
          will look at the awesomeness of hexadeimcal numbers. We'll explore the
          logic behind color hex codes, and the math that's behind converting
          between rgb and hex codes. Behind the hex codes that we are all
          familiar with is a powerful hexadecimal number systems. We'll explore
          why the base 16 number system is so common in computer science, and
          look at hexadecimals in the wild (for example, in hex speak and even
          in IP addresses!). Let's fall under the spell of hexadecimal numbers
          and learn why exactly they are so powerful and popular.

            Can we build software to solve any math problem, helping students

            optimize for speed, but how do you design algorithms to optimize for
            teaching? Let’s talk about how “mathsteps” uses code to step through
            algebra problems, how these algorithms were designed with teaching
            in mind, and why it’s so awesome that this project is open-source!

          WebAssembly, a new portable compilation target for the web, promises
          to radically change how we build web applications. In this talk, I
          will provide an overview of WebAssembly and its current implementation
          status. I will next walk through a brief step-by-step example which
          involves compiling low-level BLAS libraries to WebAssembly for high-
          performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I
          will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near
          native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance
          applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.

          I'm a huge fan of mood lighting and app reliability. Related? Of
          course!  I heard about Progressive Web Apps and thought it was a
          great way to make web applications more accessible, so I wanted to
          give it a try. (Disclaimer🤓  I don't think PWAs are going to replace
          mobile apps just yet, but I do think they're a great way to make our
          web apps even more awesome) At the same time I had been wanting to
          create an application that let me control Philips Hue lights. That
          way I could go anywhere and set the mood with my handy-dandy portable
          lights. So, if I went outside to enjoy my yard, on the roof to hang
          out with friends, or WaffleJS to chill with amazing people, I could
          easily set the appropriate mood lighting with my app.  I would like
          to share my experience with all of you and show off my new toys 😊

        description:
          React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library
          designed to manage the view layer of complex UIs. In recent
          years, it has established itself as the dominant library for
          building responsive and highly-performant interfaces. But all
          of what React does feels like it's happening in a black box!
          So, I hope to explain why React is so efficient by
          highlighting 2 key features -- React's virtual DOM and diff
          algorithm. Don't worry if you're not a React pro, this talk
          is intended to be accessible to all audiences!

          not a matter swapping out one service for another, it requires that we
          rethink many of our assumptions about trust and infrastructure. It requires
          that we build a lot more open source software infrastructure to make the
          basic tools like signing and encryption as usable as we've made the rest
          of our software infrastructure.

        title: Embracing change as an Open Source product
        emoji: 🔄
        description: |
          The Open Source project I work on, BOSH, has been able to adapt to changing
          product and engineering needs over the past 3 years. I'll talk about some of
          the major changes that we've made while growing our contributor base. We
          transitioned from waterfall to XP, scaled our team to be globally distributed,
          and replaced core architectural components with zero downtime. While the
          tech industry routinely encounters these challenges, doing so as an OS
          product and maintaining shared vision throughout presents unique challenges.

          With the `async` and `await` keywords defined in
          the latest draft standard, you can write code combining the
          results of lots of asynchronous processes as easily as if
          their results were all immediately available. This feature
          is implemented in the latest beta versions of Chrome and Firefox
          and you can get them anywhere by means of closure-compiler.

          and then demonstrate an implementation using JavaScript and WebGL.
          You will hopefully walk away with a high level understanding of

          experiment with it on your own!

          Testing front-end is tricky, it’s easy to become lenient on
          implementing front-end tests. But as many of you have experienced,
          changing just a little bit on a legacy-ish front-end application
          can become a daunting and sometimes scary. Hopefully, selenium
          which is an automated UI testing tool can help ease those concerns.
          In this talk, I’ll introduce what selenium is, how to get up and running.

        description: |
          You’re so pumped. You found an API that will bring
          your high-impact 3-month project down to 2 weeks!
          The next day, you want to flip a table because
          nobody knows how to use this API. Stack Overflow
          has failed you. Documentation is clearly a novella
          rather than being straightforward. What do you do?
          Do you just give up and build from scratch? No!
          In this talk, you will learn not to give up in these
          situations. Like Nancy Drew, you can hunt down the
          information you need and save the world... or at
          least ship your project.

        description: |
          This talk looks beyond origami as a childhood
          pastime and an art form and explores origami
          as a source of many interesting mathematical
          problems, including one called the
          fold-and-cut problem. The fold and cut theorem
          states that it is possible, given a piece of
          paper and any polygonal shape, to find a
          series of folds of that paper such that the
          given shape can be generated with a single cut.
          This talk explores a proof of the theorem and
          an implementation of a solver that determines
          the correct series of folds given any input
          polygon. There will be a live demo of the
          program and paper cutting!

          Learn about how designers and engineers worked together
          on a tool for maintaining icons and making it easy for
          developers on any platform to use the icons in their
          apps. Hear about our iterative approach to rolling out
          the Yelpicon system and how we're looking beyond icons
          to continue to tighten the gap between design and
          production code.

        description: |
          Sometimes, programming is boring. We always talk about
          it as if we're on a rocket ship that's powered by jetfuel, when really
          sometimes it's painfully mind-numbing. This talk is a
          funny take on the doldrums of the in-and-outs of programming
          professionally, that's also hopefully inspiring in its own way.

          coming to a JS meetup in San Francisco, chances are that you are an
          engineer working for a startup. This talk will cover, with math, the
          absolute bare minimum that you ought to know about how startup equity
          works. You won't walk out a finance guru, but at least you'll know
          what the words mean, and have a much better idea of what VCs and
          founders are talking about (what happens next will shock you!)
