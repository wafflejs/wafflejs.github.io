          Navigating code review comments can be difficult, especially when the feedback is given in
          tones that are harsh, blunt, and sometimes downright rude. Senior Software Engineer, Angie
          Jones, will share the 10 guidelines she follows for navigating code reviews. These
          practical tips will help lead to a productive process that will help you get your code
          accepted faster, and without the drama.

        description: |
          Most people think of P2P networks as just a playground for file sharing applications, but it
          turns out you can build other types of applications with useful characteristics such as
          enhanced privacy and security. Using the example of building a cloud file storage system
          (think Dropbox) that instead runs on a P2P network, we’ll walk through the process of
          building an increasingly complex system to touch on topics such as scaling a network’s size
          and preserving data without a database.

          [Cocoa](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3m7zeuva26t4u2/Advanced%20Cocoa%20Tutorial.pdf?dl=0),
          the "internet programming" environment that Apple built for kids in the late 90s. I'll
          fire up a Mac OS 7 emulator and show what made Cocoa so groundbreaking. I'll explain
          how "programming by demonstration" and "actor-based" educational environments lower the
          barrier to entry in computer science and establish mental models that make it easier for
          kids to write great JavaScript later. tldr: Don't teach kids to write for loops, teach
          them to think about state machines and scopes!

                     code out of the digital and into the physical. In this talk, we'll dive deep into
                     my first maker project called "Sharknicorn" -- a 3D printed unicorn horn on a shark hat
                     that has light animations depending on the realtime state of your Uber ride! We'll be going over
                     the basics of microcontroller programming along the way and some tools you can use to get started.
                     I hope this session will inspire you to scratch that maker itch and start your own project!
                     Let’s pick up our soldering irons and put on safety goggles — it’s time to make things.

        title: Exploring the Linguistics Behind Regular Expressions
        description:
          Regular expressions are one of the most mind-boggling programming techniques, but much of their mystery can be elucidated by tracking down how they made it into JavaScript in the first place.
          In this talk, I’ll tell the story of the regular expression, from its humble linguistic origins to its awe-inspiring power in modern programming languages like JavaScript.
          Once I reveal to the audience the linguistic theory behind regular expressions, they’ll feel empowered to start writing some of their own.

          How to Estimate Like a Pro
        description: |
          Fundamentally, every engineer hates/cringes when they need to give an
          estimate. We beat ourselves up over it when we get them wrong. In
          my past I've been an engineer, a lead, a product manager and
          engineering manager. This is my perspective on when/why they matter
          and when they don't. I also have a few tips for delivering estimates,
          when you actually need to give them. Hopefully, I'll deliver this
          presentation in the alotted timeframe 😎.

          to be easy to extend with your own components written in Javascript. I’ll be going through what

          Practical Things You Can Do to Protect the Privacy of Your Users
        description: |
          Protecting privacy is the right thing to do. Consider especially that
          a few of your users may be people such as political dissidents or
          victims of domestic abuse that are especially vulnerable to privacy
          violation. Protecting privacy also makes business sense. You want to
          protect against a big data breach that could destroy your company's
          reputation, or to comply with upcoming European privacy regulations
          that apply to all apps worldwide. However privacy can be hard to get a
          handle on, because it is often explained using legal jargon. In this
          talk I speak as a fellow developer and outline the practical
          engineering things you can do, concentrating on protecting data you
          store in your backends.

          using the Pebble smartwatch, I had to reclaim what I lost in a world
          of slow installations, 24KB RAM, and no JavaScript.
          I will share how I used React, TypeScript, WebSockets, JSON Schema,
          GIFs, WebGL, and other friends to regain productivity despite
          programming in C and ARM assembly.

          Coffee is an essential part of many developers' lives, but
          sometimes we need to cut back. In this talk, I'll show you how a
          small team of engineers safely and efficiently converted hundreds
          of thousands of lines of CoffeeScript, spanning thousands of files
          into modern JavaScript over a short span of time. I'll go over why
          we made the switch, how I got buy-in, and how the team was able to
          stay productive throughout the conversion.

          "Works for Me": Understanding Privilege in Tech
        description: |
          "Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed. "Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't inaccurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others. This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.

          256, 128, and of course, all of those 0's and 1's that make up binary.
          But there's one number that's super magical, and almost all of us have
          interacted with it as JavaScript developers. The number 16! This talk
          will look at the awesomeness of hexadeimcal numbers. We'll explore the
          logic behind color hex codes, and the math that's behind converting
          between rgb and hex codes. Behind the hex codes that we are all
          familiar with is a powerful hexadecimal number systems. We'll explore
          why the base 16 number system is so common in computer science, and
          look at hexadecimals in the wild (for example, in hex speak and even
          in IP addresses!). Let's fall under the spell of hexadecimal numbers
          and learn why exactly they are so powerful and popular.

          will provide an overview of WebAssembly and its current implementation

          involves compiling low-level BLAS libraries to WebAssembly for high-
          performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I
          will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near
          native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance
          applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.

          give it a try. (Disclaimer🤓  I don't think PWAs are going to replace
          mobile apps just yet, but I do think they're a great way to make our
          web apps even more awesome) At the same time I had been wanting to
          create an application that let me control Philips Hue lights. That
          way I could go anywhere and set the mood with my handy-dandy portable

        title: Why React is so Fast
        emoji: 🤔
        description:
          React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library
          designed to manage the view layer of complex UIs. In recent
          years, it has established itself as the dominant library for
          building responsive and highly-performant interfaces. But all
          of what React does feels like it's happening in a black box!
          So, I hope to explain why React is so efficient by
          highlighting 2 key features -- React's virtual DOM and diff
          algorithm. Don't worry if you're not a React pro, this talk
          is intended to be accessible to all audiences!

          We have become the largest producers of data in history. Almost every click online, each swipe on our tablets and each tap on our smartphone produces a data point in a virtual repository. There are living, breathing humans behind these spreadsheets and they took actions to create these data points. For this talk, I will talk about creating interactive graphics to visualize our digital footprints in ways that allows us to explore humanity with all its wondrous quirks.

            Building GraphQL Backend
        description: |
            GraphQL is a powerful technology providing client an efficient and elegant way to fetch data,
            getting exactly the data and avoid multiple round-trips. I'm a co-author of library called Allograph.
            Allograph aims to integrate the various tools around GraphQL to provide a rapid development framework
            to enhance developer experience. After the talk, you'll gain deeper understanding on GraphQL itself,
            with perspectives on how to build a GraphQL backend either alongside an existing app or from scratch.

          There are some cool new ways for devs to build apps without needing to
          focus on or worry about devOps, scaling, or paying hourly for serverless.
          This talk will talk about how you might be able to use some of these new
          "function as a service" providers (AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc) in
          your next (work or personal) project. 🎉

          Building applications that are resilient to hostile networks and governments is
          not a matter swapping out one service for another, it requires that we
          rethink many of our assumptions about trust and infrastructure. It requires
          that we build a lot more open source software infrastructure to make the
          basic tools like signing and encryption as usable as we've made the rest
          of our software infrastructure.

          transitioned from waterfall to XP, scaled our team to be globally distributed,
          and replaced core architectural components with zero downtime. While the
          tech industry routinely encounters these challenges, doing so as an OS
          product and maintaining shared vision throughout presents unique challenges.

          their results were all immediately available. This feature
          is implemented in the latest beta versions of Chrome and Firefox
          and you can get them anywhere by means of closure-compiler.

          can become a daunting and sometimes scary. Hopefully, selenium
          which is an automated UI testing tool can help ease those concerns.

          has failed you. Documentation is clearly a novella

          In this talk, you will learn not to give up in these

          series of folds of that paper such that the
          given shape can be generated with a single cut.
          This talk explores a proof of the theorem and
          an implementation of a solver that determines
          the correct series of folds given any input
          polygon. There will be a live demo of the
          program and paper cutting!

          Womens' Studies class, it's easy to misunderstand the context
          of this moment in a larger history of Women's Lib. I'll do a little
          overview of the 4 waves of Feminism, talk about ways to spot
          toxic patriarchy, and give some suggestions on how to be your
          best Tech Feminist!

        title: Exploring Mental Illness through Open Source
        description: For almost a year, Julia has been leading if me, an open
          source mental health community. It has allowed her to explore personal
          insecurities with mental illness, taught her how to manage and value
          contributors, and develop more robust web apps using Ruby on Rails
          and JS. She will be delving into the lessons she’s learned
          transforming a passion project into an open source project.
