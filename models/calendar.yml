        description: For almost a year, Julia has been leading if me, an open
          source mental health community. It has allowed her to explore personal
          insecurities with mental illness, taught her how to manage and value
          contributors, and develop more robust web apps using Ruby on Rails
          and JS. She will be delving into the lessons she’s learned
          transforming a passion project into an open source project.
