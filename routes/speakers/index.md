Do I need to be an expert to talk?
----------------------------------
Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to
participate. We especially encourage people of under-represented groups to
apply.

What kind of talks are you looking for?
---------------------------------------
We don't have a strict formula and we encourage you to surprise us, but this is
the balance we try to strike every month:

* **2x Creative Talks**: Creative applications of programming. Past examples
  are generating lego murals out of static images, and building an in-browser
  RPG.
* **1x Passion Talk**: Something you're excited about outside of work.  Past
  examples are starting and maintaining an open source project, and using
  meditation and programming side by side.
* **1x Technical Talk**: A deep dive on a technical topic. Past examples are
  optimizating your code for the V8 JavaScript engine, and using functional
  programming for developing UI.

How long should my talk be?
---------------------------
Ten minutes. There won't be any formal Q&A; we encourage attendees to ask
questions in person later. We also try to introduce you well enough so you can
speed through any self-bio slides.

What should be in my talk submission?
-------------------------------------
Just a few sentences describing what you want to talk about would be great.

What happens after I submit my talk?
------------------------------------
We will follow up with you via email! It may take a few days.

What's the A/V situation?
-------------------------
We'll have HDMI to plug into (for video and audio) and a mic for you to use.
Let us know if you need any fancy adapters (we'll have some Apple ones).

Do I need to submit my slides beforehand?
-----------------------------------------
Nope, but please show up at least 30 minutes before your talk.
