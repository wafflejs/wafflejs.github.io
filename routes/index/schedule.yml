    title: Turning a room into a synthesizer with a distributed harmonic series
    description: Let’s talk about what a harmonic series is. This natural
      phenomena tells us quite a bit about the symmetry found in our physiology
      and how our brain interprets it is fascinating. We’ll discover why
      certain instruments sound the way they do, and why some instruments are
      better suited for rhythm than percussion. We’ll also turn the room into a
      giant distributed synthesizer and make some noise.
