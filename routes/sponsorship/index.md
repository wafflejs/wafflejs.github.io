About
-----
WaffleJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, waffles, and karaoke.
It started when Visnu and Billy went to [BrooklynJS][1]. They were inspired by
the event and wanted to organize a Bay Area technology meetup that would do
these things:

- Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another.
- Promote a diverse and inclusive environment.
- Get people to have fun.

Today the meetup is co-organized by [Visnu][@visnup], [Billy][@billyroh], and
[Kelly][@kng], and hosted by [Emily][@nexxylove] and Visnu. It's held at [SoMa
StrEat Food Park][2] every first Wednesday of the month.

Speakers & Attendees
--------------------
Our past speakers have worked as developers at established companies, as well
as smaller startups. Here are a few of those companies:

- Google
- Mozilla
- Dropbox
- Square
- Stripe
- npm

Our attendees are roughly the same ratio of people from larger and smaller
companies, leaning toward smaller startups. Around 35% of our attendees are
women.

Diversity
---------
We believe this industry can and should be more inclusive. Here are the things
we do to make that happen:

- **Donations:**
  We donate all proceeds to Girls Who Code, a non-profit that encourages more
  women to enter the STEM field.
- **Student sponsorships:**
  We sponsor students to come to the event so they can meet more people in the
  industry. So far, we’ve had students from Hackbright and Hack Reactor.
- **Diverse speakers:**
  We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers at each of our events,
  with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.
